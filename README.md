A fun RPG mash-up of the early Sir-Tech Wizardry mazes with some Ultima flavor.

The Wizardy maps include Wizardry 1 through Wizardry 4, the Black Stone maze, and Snafaru's Dragon Quest maze.

You will also find the Ultima III Exodus dungeon maps, which were ported to the original Wizardry binary encoding format.

There are Boots of Flying from Wizardry 4 and Marks of Kings from Ultima 3 to be found in the mazes that have special uses, one of which was flying over water.

The Overworld is the Ultima 1 map.  Malor spell can be used to teleport.

This is a Maven Java project developed in the NetBeans development environment.

To journey onward, try running it from the development environment or command line, or building and executing from the jar file.

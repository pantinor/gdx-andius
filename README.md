A fun RPG game which is a mashup of the early Sir-Tech Wizardry mazes with some Ultima influence.

The Wizardy maps include Wizardry 1 through Wizardry 4, the Black Stone maze, and Snafaru's Dragon Quest maze.

You may also discover 7 of the Ultima III Exodus dungeon maps, which were ported to the original Wizardry binary encoding format.

There are boots of flying from Wizardry 4 and Marks of Kings from Ultima 3 to be fouind in the mazes that have special uses, one of which was flying over water.

The Overworld is the Ultima 1 map.  I did not add the ships yet and there are no moongates for teleporting either.

This is a Maven Java projec developed with the NetBeans development environment.

I got tired of rebuilding the zip download with every commit to keep it updated, so to journey onward, you would run it from the development environment.

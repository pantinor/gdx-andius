=========

you will find a fun RPG game here.

A Mashup of the early Sir-Tech Wizardry mazes with some Ultima influence, and Stuart Smith's classic Ali Baba thrown in.

The Wizardy maps include Wizardry 1 through Wizardry 4, the Black Stone maze, and Snafaru's Dragon Quest maze.

That's right.. Wizardry 4, as in, THE RETURN OF WERDNA..

You may also discover a few Ultima III Exodus dungeon maps during your adventures, which were ported to the original Wizardry binary encoding format.

This is a maven project..and it runs as it should, on a PEESEE.

To journey onward, download the zip file, extract, and run the "java -jar command" and have fun!

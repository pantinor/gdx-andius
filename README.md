The more daring players will prefer to learn their enemies' strengths and 
weaknesses first hand. For those who prefer to play with more exact 
knowledge, the character tables give precise attribute values. 
The characters in the table are aiphabetized by NAME. The bestiary 
describes the various CREATURE TYPES. STRENGTH affects a character's 
ability to open doors, tackle opponents, and run past foes. If a character's 
CONSTITUTION drops to zero in battle, he dies. The WEAPON POWERS for 
MELEE and HAND TO HAND combat indicate the average force of a 
blow, and are explained further in the BATTLE paragraphs. A character's 
ARMOR protects him from attacks. A creature's DEXTERITY determines its 
'attack chances and when it takes its turn. Creatures with an asterik next to 
their dexterity have an unusual ability to dodge attacks. Creatures with one 
or two G's next to their dexterity are easier or very much easier to hit. No 
character can move more than its RUNNING SPEED in a single move. If a 
character has an entry under WM LEVEL, it is a wandering monster that 
may appear on the listed level (1-4).

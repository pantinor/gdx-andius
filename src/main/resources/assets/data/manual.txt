Stat and Class Explanations 

These are more detailed explanations as it relates to Stats and Classes.

STATS:

STRENGTH:  The physical strength of a character and a primary attribute for
           fighters.  The stronger they are, the more damage they can inflict
           on a foe.

I.Q.    :  This is a primary attribute for mages.  This is what enables a mage
           to cast spells and also gives them a better percentage chance of the
           spell working.

PIETY   :  This is a primary attribute for clerics.  This is what enables a
           cleric to cast spells and also gives them a better percentage chance
           of the spell working.

VITALITY:  The health of a character.  A higher vitality translates to more hit
           points and also a better chance of being brought back from the dead.

AGILITY :  The ability of a character to get out of trouble faster then they
           got into it.  A primary attribute for thieves.

LUCK    :  The mystery factor that can have a positive influence on the above
           factors.

CLASSES:

CLERIC :  The healers of the party.  These characters are primarily around for
          not only their ability to heal party members, but also with casting
          protection spells.  They are also decent fighters.

FIGHTER:  Their purpose in life is to hack their enemies into little, bitty
          pieces.

LORD   :  A combination of a fighter and cleric.  They get the power of the
          fighter and at fourth level, they start to learn clerical spells as
          well.

MAGE   :  The magic user.  As they progress in levels, they acquire more
          devastating spells.  This more then makes up for their inability to
          do hand-to-hand combat.

NINJA  :  These are the assassins.  Ninjas have the ability to make one hit
          instant kills.  In addition, if they are unencumbered by armor, their
          armor class goes down as they level up.

SAMURAI:  A combination of a fighter and mage.  As with the lord, they get the
          power of the fighter.  At fourth level, they start to learn mage
          spells.

THIEF  :  Pretty self-explanatory.  Thieves are responsible for taking care of
          the traps on treasure chests that are found.
WIZARD :  A combination of a cleric and a mage.  Although they start out with
          mage spells, wizard's start acquiring clerical spells at fourth
          level.  They combine the best of clerics and mages to produce a
          rather well-rounded character that who is both devastating in hand-to
          -hand combat and magical combat as well.

Loot

After you defeat the monsters, you will either get the spoils of combat or you
may be presented with a treasure chest.  Your choices are:

INSPECT    :  Determine what kind of trap is on the chest.  The different types
              of traps are:

ALARM          :  Brings in surrounding monsters to do battle
                  with your party.

CLERIC'S CRISIS:  Paralyzes all clerics and wizards.

CROSSBOW BOLT  :  Hits whoever is opening the chest.

EXPLODING BOX  :  Causes shrapnel damage to all party members.

GAS BOMB       :  Poison bombs all party members with a chance of
                  actually poisoning them.

MAGE'S MISERY  :  Paralyzes all mages and wizards.

POISON NEEDLE  :  Hits the opener with a poisoned needle with a
                  chance of actually poisoning them.

STUNNER        :  Paralyzes the opener.

TELEPORTER     :  Randomly teleports the party to another part of
                                the level.

CALFO      :  Use the cleric spell to determine the trap.

DISARM     :  Select the character that you wish to disarm the trap.

OPEN       :  Just open up the chest without disarming any traps (if there are
              any).

LEAVE ALONE:  Just walk away from the chest and continue on with your journey.

Monsters

HP=HIT POINTS:  The number of hit points a monster will have.  This, like a
                character's hit points, is how much damage a monster will take
                before it is killed.  This is a random number determined by
                the dice plus any add-ons.  1D3+1 means a monster will have
                anywhere from two to four hit points.

AC=ARMOR CLASS:  How hard or easy it is to hit the monster.  The lower the
                 number, the harder it will be to hit the monster.

RG=REGENERATION:  How many hit points the monster regenerates per round.

MR=MAGICAL RESISTANCE:  This is a percentage chance that a spell will fail
                        against this monster.  This includes both direct attack
                        spells and area-effect spells.

RST=RESISTANCE(S):  These are the things the creature is resistant to.  In
                    other words, they won't be affected by attacks based on the
                    following:

                    COL=COLD
                    FIR=FIRE
                    FRI=FRIENDS (IF THIS IS SHOWN, IT MEANS A MONSTER CAN BE
                                 FRIENDLY)
                    LVD=LEVEL DRAIN

#AT=# ATTACKS:  How many attacks the monster does per round.

DAMAGE:  Amount of damage a monster does per attack.

                 with a successful hit by the monster.

BRW=BREATH WEAPON:  The type of breath weapon (if any) the monster possesses.
                    Breath weapons are:

                    POI=POISON
                    STO=STONING

CSL=CLERICAL SPELL LEVEL:  This number represents the level of cleric spells
                           the monster knows.  For example, if this number is
                           three, then the monster knows all clerical spells
                           for the first three levels.

MSL=MAGE SPELL LEVEL:  This number represents the level of mage spells the
                       monster knows.  For example, if this number is three,
                       then the monster knows all mage spells for the first
                       three levels.

ATT PROP=ATTACK PROPERTIES AND OTHER INFO:  This column represents specific
                                            attack types the monster can
                                            perform.  In addition, it also
                                            lists other characteristics
                                            regarding said monster.

                                            AKL=AUTOKILL ATTACK
                                            HLP=DOES MONSTER CALL FOR HELP?

                                            SLE=SLEEP ATTACK
                                            STO=STONING ATTACK

GRH=GROUP HELP:  These are the monsters that the current monster will appear
                 with.

%GH=% GROUP HELP:  The percentage chance that the current monster will appear
                   with the monsters under the GRH column.  A 100% means that
                   the current monster always appears with the designated GRH
                   monsters.

XP=EXPERIENCE POINTS:  This number represents the total amount of experience
                       points a monster is worth.  This number is then divided
                       by the number of people you have in your party.  For
                       example, a monster worth 600 XP will yield 100 XP per
                       character in a six-character party.

ITEMS

DMG=DAMAGE:  The amount of damage an item will do.  When you have something
             like 2D4+3, this means you roll a four-sided dice two times and
             add three to that result.  You will then get a range of 5-11 for
             damage.

TH=TO HIT BONUS:  This bonus enables your character to more easily hit a
                  monster.  This is especially useful against monsters with
                  very low armor classes.

+SW=# OF SWINGS:  How many times said weapon can be swung.  This basically
                  means if you can swing said weapon four times, your character
                  has the potential to do DMGx4.

AK=AUTOKILL:  Can said weapon allow the character to perform an autokill.

AL=ALIGNMENT:  Some weapons have alignments.  If a character with a different
               alignment attempts to equip said item, then that item will be
               cursed and have the opposite effect.  This also refers to
               whether an item is cursed.  The alignments are:

               EV=EVIL
               NE=NEUTRAL
               GO=GOOD
               NO=NO ALIGNMENT
               CU=CURSED ITEM

USAGE:  What classes of character(s) can use said item.  The classes are:

        C=CLERIC
        F=FIGHTER
        L=LORD
        M=MAGE
        N=NINJA
        S=SUMARAI
        T=THIEF
        W=WIZARD

PURPOSE:  Some items allow a character to do things above and beyond the normal
          damage for said weapon.  These items, such as the Slayer of Dragons,
          do double damage against a specific type of monster.

AA=ARMOR CLASS ADJUSTMENT:  This represents an modifications to a character's
                            armor class.  Subtract all positive numbers from
                            the current armor class and add all negative
                            numbers to it.  For example, a character with an
                            eight armor class puts on a helmet.  Since it is +1
                            for armor class (AC), the new AC is seven.
                            Conversely, if the helmet was -1, then the new AC
                            would be nine.

+MA=MAGICAL ADJUSTMENT:  This represents magical protection for a character.
                         It also represents the chance that a character will
                         not be affected by a monster's spells.

RG=REGENERATION:  Some items allow a character to heal a specific amount of hit
                  points/turn.

PROTECTION:  The item protects the character against certain types of monsters
             and reduces said monster's effects upon the character.

RESIST=RESISTANCE:  The item protects the character against certain types of
                    elements or harm.  These resistances are:

                    COLD
                    FIRE
                    LEVEL DRAIN
                    POISON
                    STONING

SPELL:  This refers mostly to scrolls and potions.  This can, though, refer
        to items such as rings, amulets, armor, and weapons.  When used, these
        items will produce some sort of spell effect.

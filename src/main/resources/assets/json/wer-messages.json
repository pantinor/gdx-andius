Kadorto\u0027s motions become\njerky, and smoke begins to pour out of\nhis knees  and elbows.  His head  pops\nopen,  and a singed high Priest climbs\nout of a concealed control cabin.\nNow you see the real truth! Kadorto is\na fake,  an invention of  the Priests,\na cunning  device to  perpetuate their\nsocial position  and control over men!\nYou laugh at the ridiculous sight of a\nhigh Priest with his robes smoldering.\nIt feels good to be alive.You take out\nthe Amulet,  and  in the  light of the\nKris,  you see it  for what  it really\nis: a dangerous trap for those unwary,\na joke  of the Gods.\nFor it  is  neither  Good or Evil, but\nfashioned out of  pure chaos.  You vow\nto \"return it\" to its Makers,  and you\nare sure the  Kris of Truth  will  aid\nyou.   But that can wait for tomorrow.\nToday is to be enjoyed!\nOutside,  into the beautiful sunshine,\nyou  walk.  Feeling  at last  free and\nalive.
